# Python-Unsupervised-Learning
Project: Identify Customer Segments
In this project, I have applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments 
of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. 
These segments would have the capacity to be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences 
that would have the highest expected rate of returns. 

The data used was provided by Udacity partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, 
and represents a real-life data science task.
